  rest; For example, rather than saying that "I did all the hard parts", list
  the hard bits that you did

  translate it or at least explain the impact. Offer hte intervewer the chance
  to drill further
- **Focus on Yourself, Not Your Team**: the interviewer want to know your
  contribution, not your teammates'. Listen to how often you say "we" and "I"
- **Give Structured Answers**:
  - **Nugget First**: give important summary first, then give the answer
  - **S.A.R**: situation -> action -> result
    - Describe action in greater detail
- Think about what qualities another person can see from your response
